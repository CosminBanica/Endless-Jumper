# Endless Jumper
 
## Controls:
W/S - set speed
A-D - move player left right
Space - jump
LCtrl - toggle first/third person

## Details:
In third person mode, the camera follows the player as he jumps, doesn't follow him left or right.

In first person mode, the camera also follows left and right.

The player has limited fuel, which is displayed in the top left; land on green tiles to gain more fuel.

Red tiles = insta death.

Orange tiles force max speed for a time and also animate player for the duration.

Yellow tiles reduce current fuel.

Blue tiles do nothing.

Green tiles restore current fuel.

The player has 2 lives; if he loses a life, he can gain more by landing on the dark green tile.

The game increases in difficulty as time goes on: higher minimal speed, faster fuel depletion, more negative platforms.
